	///- Parameters:
	/// - sport: required - the sport type
	/// - userIds: required - 1 or more userIds can be requested
	/// - ranges: the date ranges - 1 or more ranges can be requested. If the ranges overlap it is indeterministic which range the metrics will be included in.
	/// - fields: the aggregate fields being requested
	/// - completion: Function called with the `UserWorkoutResult` values returned by the server, or the error if one occurred.
